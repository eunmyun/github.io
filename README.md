# Exercise-2

## What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
  - This web page is a place to store all of the works I did.

## What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
  - http://students.washington.edu/eunmyun/info343/github.io/#/

## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
  - Slack, in class exercises

## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
  - It took about 10 hours. It took more than I expected because sometimes when I was stuck, even if it was a trivial thing, I could not figure it out.

## Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
 - I used Json file for my data, and for some reason I had to use JSON.parse in the student server, otherwise my data wouldn't load. However, the local server does not recognize my data if I used JSON.parse. Maybe pointing out the differences between the two servers might help.
